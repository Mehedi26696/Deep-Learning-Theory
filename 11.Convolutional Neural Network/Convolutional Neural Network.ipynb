    "# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?\n",
    "- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process structured grid data, such as images.\n",
    "- CNNs use a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and perform tasks like image classification, object detection, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why CNNs are Effective for Image Processing\n",
    "1. **Spatial Hierarchy**: CNNs capture spatial hierarchies in images by using multiple convolutional layers with different receptive fields.\n",
    "2. **Parameter Sharing**: Convolutional layers use the same kernel (filter) across an image, reducing the number of parameters and improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "3. **Translation Invariance**: Features detected by a filter are invariant to translation within the image, making CNNs robust to shifts and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of a CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Convolutional Layer\n",
    "- Applies filters (kernels) to input data to extract local features.\n",
    "- Each filter performs a dot product operation with the input and generates an output feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output}[i, j] = \\sum_k \\sum_l (\\text{Input}[i+k, j+l] \\times \\text{Kernel}[k, l])\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Terms:\n",
    "- **Filter/Kernel**: Small matrix applied to input data.\n",
    "- **Stride**: Step size for moving the filter.\n",
    "- **Padding**: Adding zeros around the input to preserve spatial dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Activation Function (e.g., ReLU)\n",
    "- Introduces non-linearity into the model.\n",
    "- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is the most common activation function:\n",
    "  $$ f(x) = \\max(0, x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pooling Layer\n",
    "- Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining important information.\n",
    "- Common types of pooling:\n",
    "  - **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value in a region.\n",
    "  - **Average Pooling**: Takes the average of values in a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula for Max Pooling:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output}[i, j] = \\max(\\text{Region}[i, j])\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Fully Connected (FC) Layer\n",
    "- Connects every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer.\n",
    "- Used for classification tasks by mapping features to output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dropout Layer (Optional)\n",
    "- Regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of neurons to zero during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture of a CNN\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Accepts raw image data (e.g., 28x28 grayscale image).\n",
    "2. **Convolutional Layer(s)**: Extract features using filters.\n",
    "3. **Pooling Layer(s)**: Downsample the feature maps.\n",
    "4. **Fully Connected Layer**: Map the features to output classes.\n",
    "5. **Output Layer**: Provides predictions (e.g., using Softmax activation for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters in CNN\n",
    "1. **Number of Filters**: Determines the number of feature maps.\n",
    "2. **Kernel Size**: Size of the filter (e.g., 3x3, 5x5).\n",
    "3. **Stride**: Determines the step size of the filter movement.\n",
    "4. **Padding**: Options include 'valid' (no padding) and 'same' (padding to keep dimensions constant).\n",
    "5. **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size during optimization.\n",
    "6. **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed before updating the model.\n",
    "7. **Epochs**: Number of passes through the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of CNNs\n",
    "1. **Image Classification**: Assigning labels to images (e.g., recognizing digits in MNIST).\n",
    "2. **Object Detection**: Identifying objects and their locations in images (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).\n",
    "3. **Semantic Segmentation**: Labeling each pixel of an image with a class (e.g., U-Net).\n",
    "4. **Image Generation**: Creating new images (e.g., GANs).\n",
    "5. **Medical Imaging**: Analyzing X-rays, MRIs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of CNNs\n",
    "- Automatically learns feature representations from data.\n",
    "- Handles high-dimensional data like images efficiently.\n",
    "- Reduces the need for manual feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of CNNs\n",
    "- Requires a large amount of labeled data for training.\n",
    "- Computationally expensive.\n",
    "- May struggle with spatial transformations like rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- CNNs are powerful tools for image-related tasks.\n",
    "- Key components include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\n",
    "- Proper tuning of hyperparameters and architectural design is essential for achieving optimal performance.\n",
