    "# Introduction to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fast-evolving era of artificial intelligence, Deep Learning stands as a cornerstone technology, revolutionizing how machines understand, learn, and interact with complex data. At its essence, Deep Learning AI mimics the intricate neural networks of the human brain, enabling computers to autonomously discover patterns and make decisions from vast amounts of unstructured data. This transformative field has propelled breakthroughs across various domains, from computer vision and natural language processing to healthcare diagnostics and autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network (ANN) uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a fully connected deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected sequentially.\n",
    "- Each neuron receives input from the previous layer's neurons or the input layer.\n",
    "- The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network.\n",
    "- Layers transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, enabling the network to learn complex representations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep Learning AI has gained immense popularity due to its success in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.\n",

    "- **Supervised Machine Learning:** Neural networks learn from labeled datasets to make predictions or classifications. Algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Machine Learning:** Neural networks discover patterns in unlabeled datasets. Algorithms like autoencoders and generative models are commonly applied.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learn to make decisions in dynamic environments to maximize cumulative rewards. Algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\n",
    "Artificial neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of human neurons. An ANN typically consists of:\n",
    "- **Input Layer:** Receives data from external sources.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers:** Process data through weighted connections and non-linear transformations.\n",
    "- **Output Layer:** Produces the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connections between neurons are weighted, and these weights are optimized during training to improve model accuracy.\n",
