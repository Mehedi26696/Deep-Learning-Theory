    "## üîπ Introduction\n",
    "Vanishing and exploding gradients are common issues in deep neural networks, especially in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep feedforward networks. These problems arise during backpropagation when updating weights using gradient descent.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "### **What is it?**\n",
    "- The gradients of earlier layers become **very small (close to zero)** as they propagate backward.\n",
    "- This leads to slow or **no learning** in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why does it happen?**\n",
    "- Activation functions like **sigmoid** and **tanh** squash input values into small ranges.\n",
    "- During backpropagation, repeated multiplication of small gradients leads to exponential decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effects:**\n",
    "- The early layers **fail to learn meaningful patterns**.\n",
    "- The network struggles with **long-term dependencies** in sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solutions:**\n",
    "- ‚úî **Use ReLU Activation** instead of sigmoid/tanh to prevent gradient shrinkage.\n",
    "- ‚úî **Batch Normalization** to normalize activations across layers.\n",
    "- ‚úî **LSTM & GRU** architectures for RNNs, as they manage long-term dependencies better.\n",
    "- ‚úî **Weight Initialization Techniques** like Xavier/He initialization.\n",

    "## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploding Gradient Problem\n",
    "### **What is it?**\n",
    "- The gradients **become extremely large** as they propagate backward.\n",
    "- This causes **unstable updates**, making the model **diverge** instead of converging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why does it happen?**\n",
    "- When weights are **too large**, repeated multiplication of large values causes an exponential increase.\n",
    "- Deep networks or RNNs with long sequences amplify the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effects:**\n",
    "- The model parameters change drastically, leading to **unstable training**.\n",
    "- Loss values fluctuate instead of decreasing, making optimization difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solutions:**\n",
    "- ‚úî **Gradient Clipping**: Limits gradient values to a fixed threshold to prevent extreme updates.\n",
    "- ‚úî **Proper Weight Initialization**: Using Xavier or He initialization reduces the chance of large gradients.\n",
    "- ‚úî **Smaller Learning Rate**: Reduces the step size for updates, preventing sudden weight explosions.\n",
    "- ‚úî **Use Normalization Techniques**: Batch Normalization stabilizes training.\n",

    "## üî• Conclusion\n",
    "Vanishing and exploding gradients hinder deep learning models, especially in RNNs. Proper weight initialization, activation functions, and techniques like LSTM/GRU help mitigate these problems, enabling stable and efficient training.\n",
