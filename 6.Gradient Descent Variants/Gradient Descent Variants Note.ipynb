    "### Definition\n",
    "Gradient Descent is a first-order optimization algorithm that minimizes a function by iteratively updating its parameters. It works in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Compute the gradient (slope) of the loss function with respect to the model parameters.\n",
    "2. Update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to reduce the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy\n",
    "Imagine a man standing on the top of a hill (loss function). He takes steps downhill (along the gradient) until he reaches the bottom (global or local minimum).\n",

    "# Variants of Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- In Batch Gradient Descent, the entire dataset is used to calculate the gradient and update the parameters.\n",
    "- Each iteration computes the mean gradient for all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Computes Gradient Using:** The whole training sample.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Smooth convergence.\n",
    "  - Suitable for convex or smooth error surfaces.\n",
    "  - Deterministic in nature.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "  - Requires loading the entire dataset into memory.\n",
    "  - Slow convergence.\n",
    "- **Learning Rate:** Fixed and cannot be changed dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Best suited for small datasets with smooth loss landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- In SGD, each training example is used to compute the gradient and update the parameters.\n",
    "- Instead of computing the mean gradient, SGD updates parameters more frequently (once per example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Computes Gradient Using:** A single training sample.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Efficient for large datasets as updates happen more frequently.\n",
    "  - Faster convergence for large datasets.\n",
    "  - Can escape shallow local minima easily.\n",
    "  - Learning rate can be adjusted dynamically.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - The cost function fluctuates due to noise from single examples.\n",
    "  - May not strictly reach the minimum, leading to a good but not optimal solution.\n",
    "  - Requires random shuffling of the training set for every epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Best suited for large datasets where computational efficiency is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is a hybrid approach.\n",
    "- Instead of using the entire dataset or a single example, a small batch of examples is used to compute the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Computes Gradient Using:** A small subset (mini-batch) of the training dataset.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Combines the benefits of Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent.\n",
    "  - Enables vectorized implementation for computational efficiency.\n",
    "  - Frequent updates lead to faster convergence.\n",
    "  - Balances between smoothness and noise.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - The cost function still fluctuates but less than SGD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Widely used in practice, especially for deep learning models, as it balances efficiency and stability.\n",
